# Show & Tell

## Objective
Inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed.

## Duration
1 hour

## Participants
Development Team, Stakeholders

## Outcome
Demonstration of completed work and collection.

## How to prepare for this ceremony?
Each developer should take between 5 and 10 minutes to present the work completed during the sprint. The format is preferably a muted video with the developer speaking over the video and explaining the increment, but this can vary depending on the developer’s preference.

The presentation should have a context, scope, resolution method, and demonstrate how it works.

## Recommendations for the Show & Tell presentation
- **Demonstrate Completed Work Only**: Show only finished work, such as product increments, prototypes, architecture diagrams, or high-priority bug fixes. Avoid presenting ideas or future plans.
- **Team Members Present**: Only the development team members who completed the work should perform the demonstrations, not the Scrum Master or Product.
- **Consider Recording Demos**: Recording demos in advance is beneficial to avoid last-minute issues and allows the presenter to focus on delivering the message.
- **Use Supporting Documents**: Utilize documents like Google Slides or PowerPoint to aggregate and present all relevant information, creating a systematic process for Show & Tell.
- **Present Backend Changes Clearly**: For backend changes, use non-customer facing visualizations, such as console demonstrations, database changes, or analytics tools to illustrate the work done.
- **Live or Recorded Demos**: Choose between live demos or recorded ones based on the team’s preference and the potential benefits of recording.
- **Discuss Sprint Progress**: Use Show & Tell sessions to briefly review sprint goals, progress, and challenges with stakeholders, facilitating transparency and support.
- **Non-Functional Changes**: If your changes don't have anything to show visually, it would still be beneficial to come prepared with information on why the changes are important. This is intended to assist the customer success team in understanding what we are working towards and inform them of the intentions behind the changes.
- **Absence Protocol**: If you know that you will miss a Show & Tell in advance, please record a brief explanation/demo of your work items ahead of time so we are still able to show progress during the meeting.
